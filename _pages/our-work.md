### AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section

The mission of Birmingham DSA's AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section is to contribute to the end of capitalism and racism, also known as racial capitalism. This includes the ending of all forms of material oppression based on social construction or biological existence.  

We aim to affirm, advocate for, and build a space for comrades who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) to grow, find support, and take action. We aim for these causes to form the foundation of our work, which is to support and develop non-white socialists as organizers both in DSA and in our communities. 

Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AfroSoc. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AfroSoc.

### Housing Justice Committee

We aim to organize tenants in and around Birmingham, with the goal of building support for tenants' rights and advocating into existence local ordinances that establish stronger tenant protections. 

To do this, we canvass apartment complexes and other housing developments with high rates of evictions and tenant complaints, connect with tenant unions and other housing-related organizations, and more.

We hold monthly meetings.

### Labor Committee

We aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including [District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)](https://umwa.org/about/district-20/) and their auxiliaries, [Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)](https://sbworkersunited.org/), and [BAmazonUnion](https://bamazonunion.org/) -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)](https://workerorganizing.org/), develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.

 We plan in between meetings on Discord. Our meetings are on Mondays at 7:30pm.

### Labor

As workers, we must sell our labor power to survive-it determines our relation to production, and is the primary battleground for improving our conditions and changing the world. We have a number of ongoing campaigns at any time, are working with NNJ and SJ labor committees to exchange tactics and coordinate trainings and events and campaigns, and assist local unions, individual workers, and worker centers in their struggles at the workplace, as well as train our own members to organize their workplaces.

Our meetings are on Tuesdays at 8pm, and we coordinate on Discord in between meetings.

### Mutual Aid:

Central Jersey DSA Mutual Aid’s primary goal is to provide essentials like groceries and hygiene supplies to community members in need, primarily through tablings at this time. A secondary goal is building partnerships with other organizations in Central Jersey who share our vision. Through mutual aid, we can better realize the collective power necessary to abolish systems of oppression by building a community of resistance to capitalism. We have garden projects, outreach to farms and coops and other projects going on.

Our meetings are 1st, 3rd, 5th Thursdays of each month, 6:30pm. We coordinate on Slack, and [fill out this membership form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH7zIDOVdywWr5a-Fm7jLuO7cswtEPv_lXcPYFu5F-CGLhgg/viewform) to join.

### Housing Committee:

We’re forming the Central Jersey Tenants Union, planning our outreach canvasses, and planning tenant organizing workshops. We still work in regards to forming local tenant association as well, and assist members and others on their housing struggles.

Newcomers are always welcome! If you're interested in organizing your building or neighborhood, we can talk you through the first steps and support you along the way. Meetings vary timewise.
