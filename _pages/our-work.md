### AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section

The mission of Birmingham DSA's AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section is to contribute to the end of capitalism and racism, also known as racial capitalism. This includes the ending of all forms of material oppression based on social construction or biological existence.  

We aim to affirm, advocate for, and build a space for comrades who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) to grow, find support, and take action. We aim for these causes to form the foundation of our work, which is to support and develop non-white socialists as organizers both in DSA and in our communities. 

Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AfroSoc. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AfroSoc.

### Housing Justice Committee

We aim to organize tenants in and around Birmingham, with the goal of building support for tenants' rights and advocating into existence local ordinances that establish stronger tenant protections. 

To do this, we canvass apartment complexes and other housing developments with high rates of evictions and tenant complaints, connect with tenant unions and other housing-related organizations, and more.

We hold monthly meetings.

### Labor Committee

We aim to guide labor organizing within Birmingham DSA, educate Birmingham DSA members on workplace organizing strategies and history, strengthen relationships with existing labor organizations, and build worker power within the greater Birmingham area.

To do this, we build relationships with existing unions and other worker organizations in our region -- including [District 20 locals of the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA)](https://umwa.org/about/district-20/) and their auxiliaries, [Starbucks Workers United (SBWU)](https://sbworkersunited.org/), and [BAmazonUnion](https://bamazonunion.org/) -- through strike support and community organizing. We also support new workplace organizing efforts with support from the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee (EWOC)](https://workerorganizing.org/), develop labor-related educational opportunities for both our membership and the community, and much more.
