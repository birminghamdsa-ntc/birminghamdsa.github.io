<h3 id="afrosocialists-and-socialists-of-color-afrosoc-section">AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section</h3>

<p>The mission of Birmingham DSA’s AfroSocialists and Socialists of Color (AfroSoc) Section is to contribute to the end of capitalism and racism, also known as racial capitalism. This includes the ending of all forms of material oppression based on social construction or biological existence.</p>

<p>We aim to affirm, advocate for, and build a space for comrades who self-identify as Black, Indigenous, or Persons of Color (BIPOC) to grow, find support, and take action. We aim for these causes to form the foundation of our work, which is to support and develop non-white socialists as organizers both in DSA and in our communities.</p>

<p>Any person in the Birmingham and Tuscaloosa metropolitan areas who self-identify as BIPOC can become a voting member of AfroSoc. Birmingham DSA and/or DSA membership is not required to be a voting member of AfroSoc.</p>

<h3 id="disability-solidarity">Disability Solidarity</h3>

<p>We are about disability liberation, disability justice, community access, and educating people on the realities disabled comrades face. Our fight for socialism is a fight for an inclusive society that leaves no one behind, and so we work to unite comrades and allies in our fight for liberation.</p>

<p><a href="https://forms.gle/ZohKbA6rx166DisM7">Disability Solidarity Committee Membership Form</a></p>

<h3 id="labor">Labor</h3>

<p>As workers, we must sell our labor power to survive-it determines our relation to production, and is the primary battleground for improving our conditions and changing the world. We have a number of ongoing campaigns at any time, are working with NNJ and SJ labor committees to exchange tactics and coordinate trainings and events and campaigns, and assist local unions, individual workers, and worker centers in their struggles at the workplace, as well as train our own members to organize their workplaces.</p>

<p>Our meetings are on Tuesdays at 8pm, and we coordinate on Discord in between meetings.</p>

<h3 id="mutual-aid">Mutual Aid:</h3>

<p>Central Jersey DSA Mutual Aid’s primary goal is to provide essentials like groceries and hygiene supplies to community members in need, primarily through tablings at this time. A secondary goal is building partnerships with other organizations in Central Jersey who share our vision. Through mutual aid, we can better realize the collective power necessary to abolish systems of oppression by building a community of resistance to capitalism. We have garden projects, outreach to farms and coops and other projects going on.</p>

<p>Our meetings are 1st, 3rd, 5th Thursdays of each month, 6:30pm. We coordinate on Slack, and <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScH7zIDOVdywWr5a-Fm7jLuO7cswtEPv_lXcPYFu5F-CGLhgg/viewform">fill out this membership form</a> to join.</p>

The 140+ members of Birmingham DSA are building democracy powered by US, the working class, not the capitalist class. While capitalists may have the profits, we have the people -- and only through organizing ourselves can we wield that people power to create a government, economy, and society that's for and by us.
Birmingham DSA's current projects include solidarity with organized labor and tenant unions, mutual aid, socialist feminist organizing, creating spaces for BIPOC socialists, and more.</p>
